# Pervaxis Forge BFF — Session Log

> Engineer-facing log of work, decisions, blockers, and todos for the Forge BFF (`Pervaxis.Forge.Api` + `Pervaxis.Forge.Engine`). Committed to the repo so any machine pulling the branch has full context.
>
> **Convention:** Latest entry at the top. Each entry is self-contained — a fresh Claude Code session on a new machine should be able to read the topmost entry and continue without backfill.
>
> **Companion docs:** Project narrative lives in `docs/session_log.md`. Authoritative standards in `pervaxis-forge-api/CLAUDE.md` and `docs/FORGE_*` files.

## How to bootstrap a fresh session — READ THIS FIRST

> **For a new Claude CLI session on any machine:** read this section before doing anything else. The user's auto-memory under `C:\Users\anand\.claude\projects\…\memory\` is **machine-local** and may not exist on this machine — **this file is the cross-machine source of truth.** All paths below are relative to the repo root (`pervaxis-forge/`) unless stated otherwise.

### Step 1 — read the topmost dated entry of this file

`pervaxis-forge-api/.claude/memory/session_log.md` (you're in it). The most recent dated entry is self-contained: current branch, current phase, what was just done, what's next, open blockers. Start there.

### Step 2 — read the authoritative repo docs, in this order

| Order | Path | What it gives you |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `CLAUDE.md` | Repo-level branching strategy and reading order |
| 2 | `pervaxis-forge-api/CLAUDE.md` | BFF-specific rules: file header, dependency rules, C# standards |
| 3 | `docs/FORGE_SOLUTION_STRUCTURE.md` | Folder layout, naming, project structure |
| 4 | `docs/FORGE_TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION.md` | API contracts, data models, DB schema |
| 5 | `docs/FORGE_BLUEPRINT_BFF.md` | Phase-by-phase implementation plan and current-week deadlines |
| 6 | `docs/FORGE_OVERVIEW.md` | Business context (skim only if needed) |

### Step 3 — read `.claude/` guides — but with skepticism

Located under `pervaxis-forge-api/.claude/guides/`. **Several were sourced from Pervaxis Genesis and describe code that Forge *generates*, not Forge itself.** Apply only the ones marked authoritative.

| File | When to read | Authoritative for *Forge* code? |
|---|---|---|
| `PERVAXIS_STANDARDS.md` | Before any new C# class | ✅ Yes |
| `DEPENDENCY_MANAGEMENT.md` | Before adding/changing NuGet packages | ✅ Yes |
| `GIT_WORKFLOW.md` | Before branching, committing, or PRing | ✅ Yes |
| `ci-sonarcloud-setup.md` | Before touching CI/CD | ✅ Yes |
| `GENESIS_PROVIDERS.md` | Before changing template logic that wires Genesis modules | ⚠️ Describes generated code; useful for template authoring only |
| `CLOUD_PROVIDER_SEPARATION.md` | Before changing cloud-provider resolution in templates | ⚠️ Describes generated code; useful for template authoring only |
| `OBSERVABILITY_PATTERN.md` | Skip on bootstrap | ❌ Generated-code pattern, not Forge itself |
| `RESILIENCE_PATTERN.md` | Skip on bootstrap | ❌ Generated-code pattern, not Forge itself |
| `METRICS_PATTERN.md` | Skip on bootstrap | ❌ Generated-code pattern, not Forge itself |
| `CORE_ABSTRACTIONS_COMPLIANCE.md` | Skip on bootstrap | ❌ Genesis-only, no Forge equivalent |

### Step 4 — read `.claude/` skills relevant to your current task

Located under `pervaxis-forge-api/.claude/skills/`. Read the matching skill **before** touching the matching code:

| Skill folder | Read before… |
|---|---|
| `csharp-coding-standards/` | Writing any new C# class |
| `csharp-api-design/` | Changing Engine's public API or any cross-project interface |
| `microsoft-extensions-dependency-injection/` | Editing `Program.cs` DI registrations or adding `IServiceCollection` extensions |
| `project-structure/` | Editing `.slnx`, `.csproj`, `Directory.Build.props`, `global.json`, or central package management |

### Step 5 — when guides and CLAUDE.md disagree, CLAUDE.md wins

Known conflicts the guides will pull you toward — use the CLAUDE.md / Forge-spec answer instead:
- Use the **multi-line Clarivex license header** (not the one-liner from some Genesis-sourced guides).
- `LangVersion=latest` (not `preview`).
- Test stack is **xUnit + FluentAssertions + Moq** (not NSubstitute).

### Active conventions to carry into every session

- **No local emulation** — real AWS resources only. No Docker, LocalStack, or Testcontainers in dev or CI.
- **Forge ≠ Genesis** — Forge has zero references to `Pervaxis.Core` or `Pervaxis.Genesis`.
- **Discuss before coding** — for non-trivial work, propose a plan and get explicit go-ahead before changing code.
- **One question at a time** — surface clarifications individually, never as bundled lists.
- **CI/CD from Day 1** — GitHub Actions + SonarCloud (org `clarivex-tech`, project `clarivex-tech_pervaxis-forge`; `SONAR_TOKEN` lives in GitHub repo secrets, configured by Anand).
- **Append, don't rewrite** — add a new dated entry at the top of this file; do not edit prior entries except for typo fixes.

### What you do NOT need to read on bootstrap

- The user's auto-memory under `C:\Users\anand\.claude\…` — machine-local, may not exist here. Anything load-bearing has been promoted to this log.
- Anything under `pervaxis-forge-launchpad/` — that's the UI repo's concern, separate team.
- Build/IDE artifacts: `bin/`, `obj/`, `.vs/`, `.idea/`, `*.user`.

## 2026-05-06 — Phase 0 Day 1 (Session 2): Contract + entities + CI + tests

**Branch:** `feature/api-vertical-enrollment`
**Engineer:** Anand Jayaseelan (with Claude as implementing engineer)
**Phase:** Phase 0 — Vertical Enrollment Backend (Week 1, May 6–10)

### What was done this session

1. **TODO 4 — Request/response records** (18 files, all green):
   - New supporting types: `CloudProviderConfig`, `SourceControlConfig`, `VerticalTechDefaults`, `GenerationDatabaseConfig`, `GenerationQueueConfig`, `GenerationMetadata`, `ServiceGenerationSpec`, `AwsConnectivityResult`, `GitHubConnectivityResult`
   - Filled stubs: `VerticalEnrollmentRequest`, `UpdateVerticalRequest`, `GenerationRequest`, `BatchGenerationRequest`, `VerticalResponse`, `VerticalSummaryResponse`, `ConnectivityValidationResponse`, `GenerationResult`, `BatchGenerationResult`
   - All records, all `required` modifiers, all Clarivex license headers. Build: 0 warnings, 0 errors.

2. **TODO 5 — Program.cs + Swagger wiring**:
   - Added `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore 7.*` + `Microsoft.OpenApi 1.*` + `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design 10.*` to csproj.
   - `Program.cs`: EF Core + Npgsql, Data Protection (keys → `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pervaxis.Forge\keys`), Swashbuckle with full OpenAPI info block.
   - Swagger UI gated: dev-only **OR** `Forge:EnableSwagger=true` config flag (prod opt-in without code deploy).
   - All 3 endpoint groups wired via `MapVerticalEndpoints()`, `MapGenerationEndpoints()`, `MapModuleEndpoints()` extension methods.
   - Endpoint stubs return `501 Not Implemented` with full Swagger metadata (`WithSummary`, `Produces<T>`, `ProducesProblem`).
   - `appsettings.json`: `Forge:EnableSwagger` defaulted to `false`.
   - `ForgeDbContext`: promoted from namespace-only stub to compilable skeleton (full implementation is TODO 3, which followed immediately).

3. **TODO 2 + 3 — EF entities + ForgeDbContext**:
   - All 6 entities implemented: `Vertical`, `VerticalCloudConfig`, `VerticalSourceControlConfig`, `VerticalTechDefaults`, `GenerationLog`, `DeploymentOutput` — classes (not records) per EF change-tracking requirement, `required` on mandatory props.
   - `ForgeDbContext`: full Fluent API — table names, column constraints, relationships, cascade rules, all indexes from spec (`idx_verticals_slug`, `idx_generation_logs_vertical`, `idx_generation_logs_created_at DESC`, `idx_deployment_outputs_generation`).
   - `EncryptedStringConverter` (`file sealed`) — transparent Data Protection encrypt/decrypt for `IamRoleArn` and `AccessToken`. Null-safe.
   - `GenerationLog.Manifest` stored as `jsonb`. `VerticalTechDefaults.Environments` stored as `text[]`.

4. **TODO 6 — EF migration**:
   - Installed `dotnet-ef` global tool (`--prerelease` for .NET 10).
   - Added `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design 10.*` to csproj (required for migrations, `PrivateAssets=all`).
   - Generated `20260506140655_InitialSchema`. **Not applied** — no RDS yet (Day 2).

5. **TODO 7 — CI rework**:
   - Deleted `build-test.yml` (had postgres:16 service container — violates no-local-emulation rule).
   - Created `pr-check.yml`: triggers on PR to `main`/`develop`. Runs build + non-integration tests (`--filter "Category!=Integration"`). Codecov upload. `TODO(sonar)` marker for future SonarCloud step.
   - Created `deploy.yml`: triggers on push to `main`. Same build/test pattern. `TODO` for deploy job once ECS infra is provisioned.
   - DB-dependent tests gated behind `RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS` env var (off by default until RDS exists).

6. **TODO 8 — Stub tests (one per project, CI green)**:
   - `Pervaxis.Forge.Engine.Tests` — `NamingConventionTests.NamingConvention_ClassExists_InExpectedNamespace` (smoke test; namespace/class existence assertion).
   - `Pervaxis.Forge.Api.Tests` — `VerticalServiceTests.VerticalEnrollmentRequest_CanBeConstructed_WithRequiredProperties` (full request object construction + FluentAssertions).
   - Added minimal `NamingConvention` static class stub to Engine (was namespace-only, blocked compilation).
   - Result: **2/2 passed, 0 failures**.

7. **TODO 9 — README updates**:
   - `pervaxis-forge-api/README.md`: full rewrite with prerequisites, build/test/run instructions, migration commands, Swagger opt-in instructions, key decisions table, pinned package rationale.
   - Root `README.md`: added Current Status table (BFF + UI phase, branch, status).

### Gotchas resolved this session

| Issue | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Microsoft.OpenApi.Models` not found | `Swashbuckle Version="*"` resolved to v8.x which dropped the namespace | Pinned `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore 7.*` + explicit `Microsoft.OpenApi 1.*` |
| `ForgeDbContext` not found in Program.cs | Stub was namespace-only, no class | Promoted to compilable skeleton before full implementation |
| Test run aborted — `Castle.Core lib/net6.0` not found | .NET 10 testhost assembly resolution | Added `CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies=true` to both test csproj files |
| Test run aborted — `testhost 18.3.0-release-26219-105` not found | `Version="*"` pulled nightly xUnit runner which dragged in a missing nightly testhost | Pinned `xunit 2.9.3`, `xunit.runner.visualstudio 3.1.5`, `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk 17.14.1` |
| MSB3277 EF Relational version conflict | `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing 10.*` and Api project pulling different EF Relational versions | Explicit `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational 10.*` pin in Api.Tests csproj |

### End-of-day state

- **Build:** 4/4 projects, 0 warnings, 0 errors.
- **Tests:** 2/2 passed (Engine + Api), 0 failures.
- **Migration:** `InitialSchema` generated, not applied.
- **CI:** `pr-check.yml` + `deploy.yml` in place, old postgres workflow deleted.
- **Swagger contract:** All 11 endpoints wired with full metadata — ready for UI team to consume on May 8.

### Open items for Day 2

- [ ] Align with Anand on AWS Organizations / RDS provisioning approach.
- [ ] Apply `InitialSchema` migration once RDS endpoint is available.
- [ ] Implement `VerticalService` + `IVerticalService` (enrollment, CRUD, credential encryption).
- [ ] Implement `VerticalConnectivityValidator` (STS AssumeRole dry-run + GitHub org check).
- [ ] SonarCloud bootstrap (org `clarivex-tech`, project `clarivex-tech_pervaxis-forge`, `SONAR_TOKEN` from Anand).
- [ ] Update `docs/FORGE_SOLUTION_STRUCTURE.md` — Scriban `5.*` → `7.*`, drop DataProtection PackageReference, drop Testcontainers.

### How to resume on another machine

1. `git fetch && git checkout feature/api-vertical-enrollment && git pull`
2. Read this entry top-to-bottom.
3. `dotnet restore && dotnet build && dotnet test --filter "Category!=Integration"` — should all be green.
4. Continue with Day 2 open items above.

## 2026-05-06 — Phase 0 Day 1: Alignment + skeleton fill-in

**Branch:** `feature/api-vertical-enrollment`
**Engineer:** Anand Jayaseelan (with Claude as implementing engineer)
**Phase:** Phase 0 — Vertical Enrollment Backend (Week 1, May 6 – May 10)

### What was done this session

1. Pulled latest `develop`, cut `feature/api-vertical-enrollment` from it.
   - Stashed local `.claude/settings.local.json` to `.bak` to resolve a fast-forward conflict (incoming version had a different permission set). Local backup file is gitignored / untracked; merge or delete at will.
2. Read all authoritative docs end-to-end:
   - `docs/FORGE_BLUEPRINT_BFF.md` — phase plan, Day 1 task list
   - `docs/FORGE_SOLUTION_STRUCTURE.md` — folder/project layout
   - `docs/FORGE_TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION.md` — API contracts, DB schema, entities
   - `pervaxis-forge-api/CLAUDE.md` — Forge-specific rules (file header, dependency rules)
   - All 7 guides + 4 skills under `pervaxis-forge-api/.claude/`
3. Identified that several guides are sourced from Genesis and describe *generated* code or Genesis providers, **not Forge itself** (`GENESIS_PROVIDERS.md`, `CLOUD_PROVIDER_SEPARATION.md`, `CORE_ABSTRACTIONS_COMPLIANCE.md`, `METRICS_PATTERN.md`, `OBSERVABILITY_PATTERN.md`, `RESILIENCE_PATTERN.md`). Forge has zero `Pervaxis.Core`/`Pervaxis.Genesis` references.
4. Aligned on direction with Anand. Decisions captured below.
5. **Discovered existing scaffold:** the BFF is not greenfield — commit `356b537` ("Add Vertical Enrollment module, split blueprints, and create solution skeletons") created the full file/folder skeleton, all with TODO stubs. e.g. `Vertical.cs` is `// TODO: implement Vertical entity`, `Program.cs` is a 12-line stub. Solution + projects + entity/service/endpoint files all exist; implementations do not. This shifts today from "scaffold from scratch" to "fill in the skeletons".
6. **Discovered existing CI conflicts with no-local-emulation rule:** `pervaxis-forge-api/.github/workflows/build-test.yml` runs a `postgres:16` Docker service container in GitHub Actions. Per Anand's call this morning, we use real AWS only. CI needs to be reworked — split into `pr-check.yml` + `deploy.yml`, drop the postgres service, gate DB-dependent tests behind a real-RDS env var. Codecov action present today; SonarCloud not set up.

### Decisions locked in

| Topic | Decision |
|---|---|
| Repo layout | **Mono repo.** Treat `pervaxis-forge-api/` as the BFF root inside `pervaxis-forge`. All `.slnx`, `src/`, `tests/`, `Directory.Build.props`, `nuget.config`, `global.json` live inside `pervaxis-forge-api/`. UI repo split deferred. |
| Local emulation | **None.** No Docker, LocalStack, or Testcontainers. Use real AWS resources for PostgreSQL, S3, Secrets Manager, etc., even in dev. Ignore LocalStack references in the blueprint. |
| CI/CD | **Set up Day 1.** GitHub Actions + SonarCloud per `pervaxis-forge-api/.claude/guides/ci-sonarcloud-setup.md`. Two workflow files (`pr-check.yml`, `deploy.yml`). Sonar gates only PRs targeting `main` (free-tier constraint). |
| Doc conflicts | CLAUDE.md + `FORGE_SOLUTION_STRUCTURE.md` win over Genesis-sourced guides. Specifically: multi-line copyright header (not the one-liner), `LangVersion=latest` (not `preview`), xUnit + FluentAssertions + Moq (not NSubstitute). |
| EF entities vs DTOs | **Classes for EF entities** (need settable properties for change tracking); **records with `required` for DTOs/Requests/Responses**. |
| Auth | **Deferred** — Phase 0 endpoints run unauthenticated in dev. `forge-admin` role enforcement is a post-Phase-0 concern. |
| Data Protection keys | Persist to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pervaxis.Forge\keys` in dev. Prod key store (S3 / Secrets Manager) is a Phase 3 task. |

### Open blockers / questions — resolved

| # | Question | Answer |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | AWS PostgreSQL endpoint? | **Deferred to Day 2.** No RDS today; we'll plan AWS Organizations + RDS together tomorrow morning. Today: write entities + migration without applying. |
| 2 | AWS creds for Forge account? | `.aws/credentials` exists locally. Not used today — code work doesn't need AWS. |
| 3 | GitHub remote? | Confirmed `clarivex-tech/pervaxis-forge`. Branch protection state TBD; will respect as configured. |
| 4 | SonarCloud? | **Skip for today.** Not yet set up. Ship CI with build+test only; leave TODO for Sonar bootstrap on a follow-up PR. Keys provided by Anand for the follow-up: org `clarivex-tech`, project `clarivex-tech_pervaxis-forge`. `SONAR_TOKEN` secret still TBD. |
| 5 | AWS Organizations? | **Deferred to Day 2.** Anand to research independently today; we align tomorrow. Lean: single account for now, Organizations as a separate dedicated effort. |

### Today's TODO (Phase 0 Day 1 — revised after skeleton discovery)

Order optimized for the **May 8 contract deadline** — request/response records before DB internals. Local toolchain confirmed: .NET SDK 10.0.203 installed.

- [x] 1. Verify existing scaffold matches `FORGE_SOLUTION_STRUCTURE.md`: `Directory.Build.props`, `nuget.config`, `Pervaxis.Forge.slnx`, `.gitignore`, csproj contents. Add `global.json` pinning SDK 10.0.203 if missing. **Done — see "TODO 1 results" below.**
- [ ] 2. Implement EF entities (fill in stubs) under `src/Pervaxis.Forge.Api/Data/Entities/`:
  - `Vertical`, `VerticalCloudConfig`, `VerticalSourceControlConfig`, `VerticalTechDefaults`, `GenerationLog`, `DeploymentOutput`
  - `required` modifier on mandatory props per CLAUDE.md
  - Multi-line Clarivex license header on every `.cs` file
- [ ] 3. Implement `ForgeDbContext` — DbSets, Fluent API relationships, indexes, encrypted-property value converters using Data Protection (`IDataProtector`)
- [ ] 4. Implement request/response records under `src/Pervaxis.Forge.Api/Models/` — **the contract to UI by May 8**:
  - Requests: `VerticalEnrollmentRequest`, `UpdateVerticalRequest`, `CloudProviderConfig`, `SourceControlConfig`, `VerticalTechDefaults` (DTO), `GenerationRequest`, `BatchGenerationRequest`
  - Responses: `VerticalResponse`, `VerticalSummaryResponse`, `ConnectivityValidationResponse`, `GenerationResult`, `BatchGenerationResult`
- [ ] 5. Wire DI in `Program.cs`: EF Core + Npgsql, Data Protection (keys → `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pervaxis.Forge\keys` in dev), Swagger with full doc, endpoint mapping. Endpoints return `Results.Problem(statusCode: 501, title: "Not implemented")` for now — but signatures + Swagger metadata are final.
- [ ] 6. Generate initial EF Core migration: `dotnet ef migrations add InitialSchema`. **Do not** run `database update` (no RDS yet).
- [ ] 7. **Rework CI**: split `build-test.yml` → `pr-check.yml` + `deploy.yml`. Drop the `postgres:16` service container. DB-tagged tests gated behind `RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS` env var (off by default until RDS exists). Add `# TODO(sonar)` markers where Sonar steps will slot in.
- [ ] 8. Implement one passing test in each of `Pervaxis.Forge.Api.Tests` and `Pervaxis.Forge.Engine.Tests` so CI has green tests to run. (Real coverage comes Day 2+.)
- [ ] 9. Update README.md (root + `pervaxis-forge-api/`) with run instructions.
- [ ] 10. Update this session log with end-of-day status. Commit on `feature/api-vertical-enrollment`.

**Out of scope for today (parked for Day 2):**
- AWS Organizations design + provisioning
- RDS provisioning + applying the migration
- Implementing `VerticalService`, `VerticalConnectivityValidator` (those need Data Protection + AWS SDK; Day 1-2 in blueprint)
- Implementing endpoints beyond stubs
- SonarCloud bootstrap

### Hard deadlines this week

- **May 8 (Fri)** — Swagger JSON contract delivered to UI team (they're mocking against it from Day 1)
- **May 10 (Sun)** — UI swaps mock for real API in dev environment

### Notes / challenges

- `feature/api-vertical-enrollment` branch name doesn't follow the `feature/<ticket-id>-...` example in `PERVAXIS_STANDARDS.md`, but matches the descriptive style allowed by `GIT_WORKFLOW.md`. Keeping as-is.
- Local backup file `.claude/settings.local.json.bak` is sitting in the working tree — Anand can decide whether to merge his local perms back in or just keep the version that came in via develop.
- Untracked stray folder: `docs/.claude/` (probably a misplaced settings file from earlier work). Worth cleaning up before any commits.
- Solution Structure shows entities in `Pervaxis.Forge.Api/Data/Entities/` (not in a separate domain library). Tech Spec §8.2 also shows them as plain classes. Sticking with both.
- Existing CI's postgres service container is the most visible legacy of the "Docker-friendly" assumption. Removing it without replacement means DB-dependent tests must be gated until real RDS exists. Trade-off: less test coverage in CI for Day 1, but consistent with the no-local-emulation policy.
- Codecov is wired in the existing CI. Keep it for now (free, zero-config) and revisit once SonarCloud is set up.

### TODO 1 results — scaffold audit + green build (afternoon, 2026-05-06)

**Audit results vs `FORGE_SOLUTION_STRUCTURE.md`:**

| File | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Directory.Build.props` | ✅ Match | All 5 properties exact match to §1.2. |
| `nuget.config` | ✅ Match | Single `nuget.org` feed; Pervaxis.Core feed correctly excluded with explanatory comment. |
| `Pervaxis.Forge.slnx` | ✅ Match | All 4 projects referenced. |
| Root `.gitignore` | ✅ OK | Comprehensive .NET Dotnet.gitignore template. |
| `pervaxis-forge-api/.gitignore` | ⚠️ Minimal but harmless | 6-line redundant subset of root; left as-is. |
| `Pervaxis.Forge.Engine.csproj` | ✏️ Fixed | Bumped `Scriban` from `5.*` → `7.*` — see "Scriban CVE remediation" below. |
| `Pervaxis.Forge.Api.csproj` | ✏️ Fixed | Removed `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection` PackageReference — `NU1510` (it's in the ASP.NET Core shared framework on .NET 10). DataProtection APIs still available via the framework. |
| `Pervaxis.Forge.Engine.Tests.csproj` | ✅ Match | xunit + FluentAssertions + Moq, no Testcontainers. |
| `Pervaxis.Forge.Api.Tests.csproj` | ✏️ Fixed | Removed `Testcontainers.PostgreSql` — violates the no-local-emulation rule from this morning's call. |
| `global.json` | ➕ Added | New file pinning SDK to `10.0.203`, `rollForward: latestPatch`, `allowPrerelease: false`. SDK 10.0.203 confirmed installed locally. |

**Scriban CVE remediation (security-driven, not in original spec):**

`Scriban 5.*` floats to `5.12.1`, which has 12 active GHSA advisories: 1 critical (GHSA-5wr9-m6jw-xx44, member-filter bypass), 7 high, 4 moderate. With `<TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors>` plus .NET 10's default `NuGetAudit`, all 12 promoted to errors and blocked `dotnet restore`. All advisories fixed in Scriban `7.0.0+`. Latest stable is `7.1.0` (released 2026-04-08). Bumped to `7.*`. Scriban 7.x API is API-compatible with 5.x for our usage (load .sbn, render with model, ZIP output) — no code changes needed in Engine. Action: update `FORGE_SOLUTION_STRUCTURE.md` §1.3 example from `5.*` → `7.*` in a follow-up doc PR (not done today).

**Program.cs stub trimmed:**

The skeleton `Program.cs` referenced Swashbuckle methods (`AddSwaggerGen`/`UseSwagger`/`UseSwaggerUI`) without the package. Stripped to the minimal-compiling form `var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args); var app = builder.Build(); app.Run();` with a TODO pointing to TODO 5. Full OpenAPI/Swagger wiring (likely .NET 10 built-in `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` or Swashbuckle — call to make in TODO 5) comes when we wire DI properly.

**Final state:** `dotnet restore` clean, `dotnet build` green — 4/4 projects, 0 warnings, 0 errors.

**Open follow-ups from TODO 1:**

- Update `docs/FORGE_SOLUTION_STRUCTURE.md` §1.3 — change Scriban example version `5.*` → `7.*`.
- Update §1.4 example — drop `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection` PackageReference (it's in the shared framework on .NET 10).
- Update §1.5 example — drop `Testcontainers.PostgreSql` per no-local-emulation rule.
- Decide OpenAPI approach in TODO 5: `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` (built-in, spec-only) vs Swashbuckle (external, includes UI). May 8 deadline is "Swagger JSON contract delivered to UI team" — both produce JSON; Swashbuckle adds the UI page.

### How to resume on another machine

1. `git fetch && git checkout feature/api-vertical-enrollment && git pull`
2. Read this entry top-to-bottom.
3. Check off completed todos, append new findings, ask Anand for any unresolved blockers.
4. Continue with the next unchecked item.
